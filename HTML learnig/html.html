                found a love for me
        Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
        Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
        Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
        'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
        Not knowing what it was
        I will not give you up this time
        But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
        And in your eyes you're holding mine

        Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
        Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
        When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
        But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

        Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
        She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
        I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
        To carry love, to carry children of our own
        We are still kids, but we're so in love
        Fighting against all odds
        I know we'll be alright this time
        Darling, just hold my hand
        Be my girl, I'll be your man
        I see my future in your eyes

        Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
        Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
        When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
        I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

        Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
        Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
        I have faith in what I see
        Now I know I have met an angel in person
        And she looks perfect, no I don't deserve this
        You look perfect tonight
