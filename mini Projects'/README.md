# ðŸ§© Mini Web Development Projects

Hey there ðŸ‘‹

This is where Iâ€™m adding all my **mini but interesting web development projects** â€” built while learning and practicing frontend skills like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Each project is small, focused, and helps me apply concepts in a practical way.

> Feel free to check them out, explore the code, and try them live!

Thanks for stopping by ðŸ™Œ
